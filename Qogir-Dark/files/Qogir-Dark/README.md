I have uploaded this theme here for convenience only. All credit goes to the original author(s). See [https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme) for more information.

For theme variations, accent color variations, associated icon theme, etc. see theme homepage linked above or visit theme page on [Pling.com](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1230631)

Theme supports gtk2, gtk3, gtk4, and cinnamon.

## Installation

Most easily installed via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings.

To allow the GTK2, GTK3, and GTK4 themes to apply to GUI apps running as root, run this command in your terminal after installation to create a symlink to the theme in the local system theme directory.

`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/themes; sudo ln -s ~/.themes/Qogir-Dark /usr/local/share/themes/`
