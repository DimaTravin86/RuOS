## CGreen

#### A semi-transparent Cinnamon theme for Matcha-Dark-Sea and the Numix-Circle icon theme, with Firefox extra. Inspired by the CBlack theme (author: cloweling).
If you want a panel that is not transparent, modify the line `300` of the file `~/.themes/CGreen/cinnamon/cinnamon.css`.
For example: background-color: rgba(53, 57, 69, `0.50`); . A value of `0` is equivalent to total transparency and `1` is totally opaque. Restart Cinnamon (Ctrl+Alt+Esc) for immediate modification..


## Firefox extra

### This is a css file that changes the color of the address bar according to the security of a site:
Just copy the file `~/.themes/CGreen/cinnamon/userChrome.css` and paste it into `~/.mozilla/firefox/YOUR_PROFILE/chrome/`. If the `chrome` directory is not present in your profile, you will need to create it.
