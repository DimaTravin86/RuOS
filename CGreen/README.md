## CGreen

### A semi-transparent Cinnamon theme, with Firefox extra and Conky. Inspired by the CBlack theme (author: cloweling).
If you want a panel that is not transparent, modify the line `300` of the file `~/.themes/CGreen/cinnamon/cinnamon.css`.
For example: background-color: rgba(53, 57, 69, `0.50`); . A value of `0` is equivalent to total transparency and `1` is totally opaque. Restart Cinnamon (Ctrl+Alt+Esc) for immediate modification.


## Firefox extra

#### This is a css file that changes the color of the address bar according to the security of a site:
Just copy the file `~/.themes/CGreen/cinnamon/userChrome.css` and paste it into `~/.mozilla/firefox/YOUR_PROFILE/chrome/`. If the `chrome` directory is not present in your profile, you will need to create it.

#### From Firefox 69 and after:
You must type `about:config` in the address bar and then modify the value `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` by double-clicking on it to switch it to `TRUE`.

#### /!\ IMPORTANT: From Firefox 75 and after /!\
You must also change the following key to `FALSE`: `browser.urlbar.update1`

**Without this modifications, the extra doesn't work.**


## Conky
* Install the `conky` or `conky-all` package, depending on the GNU/Linux distribution. `curl` must already be present, if it isn't, you should install it as well.

* Download the Brizel font [here](https://dl.dafont.com/dl/?f=brizel), then unzip into `~/.local/share/fonts`. The `fc-cache -f -v` command may be needed to update the fonts.

* Copy the file located in `~/.themes/CGreen/cinnamon/TimeFull` and paste it into `~/.conky` (these are hidden folders: Ctrl+h to show them). You must also allow the file to run with the command `chmod 750 ~/.conky/TimeFull`. More informations can be found at the beginning of the file.
