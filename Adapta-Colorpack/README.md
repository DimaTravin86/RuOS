!(Logo)[icon.png]
A theme pack based on the Material Design guidelines, available in normal, eta (compact), nokto (dark) and nokto eta variants, each with 16 accent colors. This is a theme pack, meaning that you will get all color themes. Forked from Adapta-Projects/Adapta-Colorpack, in which the author decided to start over. That theme is by itself forked from the original Adapta theme, which is by itself forked from the Materia theme by nana-4. github.com/Secret-chest/Adapta-Colorpack
