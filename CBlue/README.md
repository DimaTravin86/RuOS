A Cinnamon 4 theme with wallpaper for Arc-Dark/Arc-Dark-solid and the Numix-Circle icon theme, inspired by CBlack theme (author: cloweling).

If you want a panel that is not transparent, change line 304 of the file ~/.themes/CBlue/cinnamon/cinnamon.css. For example: background-color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 0.50); . A value of 0 is equivalent to total transparency and 1 is totally opaque.
