## CBlue

**A Cinnamon 4 theme with wallpaper for Arc-Dark/Arc-Dark-solid and the Numix-Circle icon theme, inspired by CBlack theme (author: cloweling).**

If you want a panel that is not transparent, modify the line `304` of the file `~/.themes/CBlue/cinnamon/cinnamon.css`. For example: background-color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 20, 20, `0.50`); . A value of `0` is equivalent to total transparency and `1` is totally opaque.

## Wallpaper

It is located in the directory `~/.themes/CBlue/cinnamon/`

## Version

* 1.0: first version
* 1.1: Fix bug Grouped Window List Applet for panel left/right
