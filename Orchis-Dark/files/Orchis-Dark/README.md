For theme and accent color variations see theme homepage linked above or visit theme page on [Pling.com](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1357889)

## Installation

Most easily installed via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings.

To allow the GTK2, GTK3, and GTK4 themes to apply to GUI apps running as root, run this command in your terminal after installation to create a symlink to the theme in the local system theme directory.

`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/themes; sudo ln -s ~/.themes/Orchis-Dark /usr/local/share/themes/`
